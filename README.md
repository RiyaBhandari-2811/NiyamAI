## Setup

After cloning the repository or pulling the latest changes, follow these steps to set up your local environment:

### 1. Install Node.js, npm, and npx (if not installed)

1. Download Node.js (includes npm & npx) from https://nodejs.org/  
   Recommended: LTS version.

2. Run the installer and keep default settings.  
   Make sure “Add to PATH” is checked.

3. Verify installation:

```bash
node -v   # should show Node.js version
npm -v    # should show npm version
npx -v    # should show npx version
````

### 2. Install project dependencies

Once Node.js and npm are installed, install the dependencies for this project:

```bash
cd niyam-ai-web && npm install
```
